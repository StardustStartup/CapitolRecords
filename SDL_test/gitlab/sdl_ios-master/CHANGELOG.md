* Fixed initial data being sent multiple times.
* Fixed CreateInteractionChoiceSet being sent multiple times and sometimes not working.
* Fixed implementing a delegate method that no longer exists.
* Fixed UI buttons not updating upon connecting.
* Added a soft button.

## 4.3.0 Beta 4 Release Notes (Since Beta 3)
### Enhancements
* Fix resource bundle not being included via cocoapods, causing a failure on the default lock screen. Also added better failure messages. The resource bundle will still have to be manually added to your app's copy resources build phase.
* Reduced resource bundle size by optimizing lock screen images.
* RPC handlers are no longer readonly and can now be set outside of the init.
* Improved the example app with additional code and features to see how the new dev api works. Stay tuned for a few additional features.

## 4.3.0 Beta 3 Release Notes (Since Beta 2)
### Breaking Changes
* `resumeHash` is now a configuration property and is not automatically handled.
* `SDLFile` and `SDLArtwork` initializers no longer contain "ephemeral", these are renamed to simply start with "file" since they are the default case.
* `SDLManagerDelegate` no longer has the method `managerDidBecomeReady`. Use the ready block on `start` instead.
* `SDLManagerDelegate` parameters are now nonnull.
* `SDLLockScreenConfiguration` `showInOptional` is now `showInOptionalState`.
* `SDLLifecycleConfiguration` `port` is now a `UInt16` instead of a `NSString`.
* Many block parameters changed names to be more consistent and descriptive.

### Enhancements
* The `OnKeyboardInput` RPC notification is now properly included and sent.
* `SDLLifecycleManager` now only sends the "Ready" notification if registration succeeded.
* `SDLManagerDelegate` `hmiLevel:didChangeToLevel:` is now sent right after becoming ready with the current HMI level.
* `SDLLifecycleConfiguration` `ipAddress` is now null_resettable.
* `SDLLifecycleConfiguration` can now contain security managers which will properly be added to the internal `SDLProxy` as appropriate.
* `SDLLifecycleConfiguration` now has a `logFlags` parameter which can be set to alter how SDL logs out data or to prevent it from doing so at all.
* If `RegisterAppInterfaceResponse` returns `WARNINGS` or `RESUME_FAILED` still successfully connect, but set the error properly of the ready block with the relevant information.
* Added backward compatible `NSNotification` subclasses to more clearly describe what type of object it contains.
* Documentation enhancements.

### Bug Fixes
* `SDLFileManager` `deleteRemoteFileWithName:completionHandler:` no longer crashes if no completion handler is set.
* `SDLFileManager` `uploadRemoteFileWithName:completionHandler:` no longer crashes if no completion handler is set.
* `SDLFileManager` will more efficiently clean up temporary files.
* Remove some unneeded methods from `SDLLockScreenViewController`.
* Properly send `AppHMIType` and `TTSName` set in `SDLLifecycleConfiguration` to the `RegisterAppInterface`.
* Strong / weak dance bugs fixed.
* Unit test fixes.

### Internal enhancements
* `SDLStateMachine` now has some public keys to help accessing data internally.
* `SDLResponseDispatcher` updates: fixing a method name, fixing an enum equality check, clarity updates.
* `SDLLifecycleManager` remove `stateTransitionNotificationName`.
* Some `NSOperation` subclass code was shifted to an intermediate superclass.
* Fixed some instance variables not having generics.
* Updated code to match v4.2.3.

## 4.3.0 Beta 2 Release Notes (Since Beta 1)
### Enhancements
* Starting up `SDLManager` now requires a block which will pass back an error if it failed.
* `SDLManager` now provides a method to call in `AppDelegate applicationWillTerminate:` that will prevent killed apps from being unable to re-register.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed a memory leak caused by the strong / weak block dance.

### Other
* Currently removed automatic resumption. Resumption will return in a future build as a manual configuration pass in.

## 4.3.0 Beta 1 Release Notes (Since Alpha 1)
### Breaking Changes
* State machine transition names are no longer public to allow for behind the scenes changes without minor or major version changes.

### Enhancements
* SDLFile, if initialized with NSData, will no longer write that data to disk, instead, it is stored in RAM. SDLFiles initialized with a file URL will continue to keep that data on disk until needed.
* The default lock screen text is now localized into Spanish, French, German, Japenese, and Chinese.

### Bug Fixes
* If the lifecycle manager or any of its consituent managers fail to start, the lifecycle manager will disconnect or unregister and an error will be logged.
* SDLLockScreenManager should use less RAM.
* Fixed test failures.

## 4.3.0 Alpha 1 Release Notes
### Deprecations
* Deprecate SDLProxy in favor of SDLManager. A future major release will remove and alter many public APIs, but they will not be deprecated in this release because they will not be replaced in this release.

### Enhancements
* Release a whole new way of reasoning about interacting with SDL. This new high-level API, and it is largely modular with "managers" for various aspects of SDL. This will be extended as time goes on with various new managers based on aspects of SDL and app development (https://www.github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/issues/223, https://www.github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/issues/241, https://www.github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/issues/298). @joeljfischer, @adein, @justinjdickow, @asm09fsu
  * Add a new set of configurations that will be set before startup and allows the manager to take care of quite a bit of setup boilerplate on its own.
  * Release a Permission Manager that allows a developer to check which SDL RPCs are avaiable to use and monitor the ability to use them.
  * Release a File Manager that abstracts the process of tracking files on the remote head unit, uploading, and deleting files.
  * Release a Lock Screen Manager that tracks appropriate times to show a lock screen and comes with a default lock screen view controller that allows for some customizability.
  * All RPCs sent through the primary manager (SDLManager) are tracked and can have a block called with the request and response when the response is returned from the remote head unit.
  * All RPCs sent will have their correlation ids managed by the SDL library.
  * Particular RPCs can now have an additional block used with them that can be called under certain conditions. For example, RPCs that create buttons (such as soft buttons) can have a block handler that will be called when an event occurs on the button.
  * Underlying the new high-level API are a few dispatchers, particularly the Notification Dispatcher which sends many notifications when new RPC notifications and responses are sent from the remote head unit. This may be used by the developer now, but will become less useful as more managers are released.

## 4.2.0 Beta 1 Release Notes
### Enhancements
* Add an AppInfo struct to RegisterAppInterface automatically with some application details, so that the head unit may automatically launch some apps via IAP if supported (https://www.github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/issues/398, https://www.github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/issues/431).
* Add a touch manager to the streaming media manager. The touch manager will watch for touch events and generate gesture recognizer-like callbacks (https://www.github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/issues/402, https://www.github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/issues/423).
* The streaming media manager now supports custom encoder settings and better default settings, as well as automatically creates a video based on the display capabilites sent by the head unit in register app interface response (https://www.github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/issues/400, https://www.github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/issues/406).
* Add support for linking an external encryption library to the SDL iOS library so that SDL data on the transport may be TLS encrypted (https://www.github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/issues/348).

### Bug Fixes
* Store sessionIds and service metadata together in the protocol code (https://www.github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/issues/350).
* Fixed a streaming media manager enum casing issue by deprecating the incorrect cased enum and adding a correctly cased one (https://www.github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/issues/383, https://www.github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/issues/411).

## 4.1.5 Release Notes
### Bug Fixes
* Since Apple is disallowing virtually all HTTP requests in Jan. 2017, SDLURLSession will now take all HTTP requests and attempt them over HTTPS. Some cars off the line still have HTTP URLs hardcoded into them, therefore this is a necessary precaution.

## 4.1.4 Release Notes
### Bug Fixes
* Fixed exception causing app to crash when SDL Core disconnects in TCP debug mode. Warning: The app may enter an undefined connection state as there is currently no retry strategy in TCP debug mode.

### Other
* Update test frameworks

### Other
* Shift project and code files into the root directory, removing the SmartDeviceLink-iOS directory. (https://www.github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/issues/404)

## 4.1.2 Release Notes
### Bugfixes
* Enable additional static analyzer rules for Xcode 7.3, fix an associated nullability issue.

### Other

## 4.1.1 Release Notes
### Bug Fixes
* Fixed passing in wrong type, causing SDL Protocol v1 to fail.
* Fix `SDLRPCStruct` subclasses generating an incorrect description when logged.

### Other
* Some repository files are now linked into the Xcode project.
* Updated testing dependencies for Xcode 7.3 compatibility.

## 4.1.0 Release Notes
### Enhancements
* The `LAUNCH_APP` system request was implemented.
* The proxy now tracks application state and relays that information to the Head Unit on v4 and above.

### Bug Fixes
* `[SDLProxyListener onProxyOpened]` will only be called when the RPC service starts, instead of any service.
* Sending heartbeat has been deprecated. The iOS proxy will now only respond to heartbeats.
* `SYSTEM_REQUEST` RPC now properly uploads and returns data.
* `SDLStreamingMediaManager`'s version check now correctly compares versions

### Other
* Updates to the README with "Getting Started" code, and updated information on testing.
* License copyright updated to 2016.
* All testing frameworks are removed from the repository and must be bootstrapped when wanted.

### Deprecations

## 4.0.3 Release Notes

### Enhancements
* Implement HTTP System Requests for policy updates

### Bug Fixes
* Revert the reachability code in TCP. If you were having trouble with connecting to SDL Core, this should fix that particular bug.

### Other
* Fixed numerous broken tests
* Moved templates and CONTRIBUTING to .github
* Enable code coverage by default when testing

## 4.0.2 Release Notes

### Bug Fixes
* Debug logging is a bit better designed and is faster, and file logging happens on a separate queue.
* IAP code no longer causes an unnecessary 3 minute background timer to be set. External Accessory applications already get all the background time they need.
* SDLProxyListener delegate callbacks had some misnamed parameters 'request' should be 'response'.
* SDLProxyListener was marking the wrong type for a passed delegate object. `onOnLockScreenNotification:` now correctly passes a type `SDLOnLockScreenStatus` instead of an `SDLLockScreenStatus`.
* Return `nil` if an object was never set to an RPC. This fixes many unit tests.
* Don't allow `SDLRPCStruct` to initialize with a `nil` backing store. This fixes unit tests.
* MTU size has been fixed to be base 8 based instead of base 10.

### Other
* Apple broke SDL's app launching scheme in iOS 9.0, so this code has been removed from the project. Apple fixed a bug in iOS 9.2 that alleviates much of the missing functionality.
* The example app no longer has video and audio code, and its app type is now `MEDIA` instead of `NAVIGATION`.
* Travis CI builds are fixed
* Pull-Request and Issue templates have been added
